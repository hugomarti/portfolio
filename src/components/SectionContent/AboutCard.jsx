          With fifteen years in the audio engineering and music business field,
          I have this year decided to persue my passion of frontend web
          development with the goal of making it my full time career.
          <br />
          <br />
          Iâ€™m keen to connect with web development companies in Spain to explore
          the opportunity of entry level roles and internships to get a more
          indepth understanding of the industry.
